    <h4> Hoang- Student ID: S3818202</h4>

    <p>Hello everyone! My full name is Bui Hoang, I’m 22 years old and I’m from Hanoi. Right now, I study a Bachelor of Information of Technology at RMIT Vietnam but before that, I was a student of Hanoi University of Science. I enjoy playing video games and playing soccer with my friends in my free time. I had my first PC when I was 5, so I have approached the computer from a very early. Then, instead of hanging out to the street, I spent all day playing videos game and exploring my PC. For me, that time in part build my IT interests. Before I go to RMIT, I don’t have any experience in IT major but I believe that I will have a good knowledge of IT ecosystems and able to use all common program languages.</p>

    <h4> Hoang -Autonomous vehicles area </h4>

    <b> 1) What does it do?</b>

    <p>An Autonomous Driving (AV), also known as a self-driving car or driverless car, robotic car, is a vehicle that is capable of sensing its environment and moving safely with little or no human input. A human passenger is not required to take control of the vehicle at any time, nor is a human passenger required to be present in the vehicle at all. Autonomous Driving can help the vehicle go anywhere as a traditional car go and do anything as an experienced driver do. </p>

    <p>Driverless car work defends on sensors, actuators, complex algorithms, machine learning systems, and powerful processors. All the information input from the environment will be processed by sophisticated software. This software will help the vehicle run follow traffic rules and navigate obstacles. There are 6 of automation levels that mean how technology interferes with the vehicle: from level 1 working as an assistance tool driver to level 6 full automation without human. </p>

    <p>In present, driverless cars can run in a specific route without any human action, we have seen more and more autonomous elements becomes a part of our everyday driving lives. The autonomous cars in Level 1 to level 3 is quite common nowadays. Even in many high-end models, autonomous driving become a standard of their cars. For example, automatic parking becomes a characteristic of BMW and Mercedes.</p>

    <p>As the software improve day by day and the development of technology and GPS net. Driverless cars in the future will become more convenient and safer. Obviously, the price will come down as technology evolves, all vehicles will be Level 5 fully autonomous in the next future. </p>

    <b>2) What is the likely impact?</b>

    <p>Impact for driver</p>

    <p>Autonomous Driving provides increased safety on the road, elimination of driving fatigue, helps drivers being able to sleep during overnight journeys and help people who are not able to drive- due to factors like age and disabilities- could be able to use automated cars as more transport systems. Improving productivity in the workplace as fewer people would have to worry commuting and their stresses.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, the fact that people will change to use autonomous driving instead of traditional cars. A lot of people work mainly by vehicle will be affected because of it. To be more specific, people work in delivery services and taxi services can lose their job with the robot.  </p>

    <p>Road safety</p>

    <p>The improved safety of roads filled with autonomous vehicles. By removing the human element of driving such as emotions, actions and delay in reactions. We can reduce a lot of the majority of traffic accidents today. Truly, as a reposted in 1.8 million testing miles, Google’s self-driving just had 13 accidents and all of them were caused by the other cars. And with the development of technology, their safety rate will be improving day by day.</p>

    <p>Insurance </p>

    <p>Because of no driver, a lot of insurance policy will be changing for suitable will the new type of cars. For example, they will have insurance for the owner of the vehicle that have errors in the software. A policy cover customers against hacking car software systems.</p>
