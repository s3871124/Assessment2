    <p>Hello everyone! My full name is Bui Hoang, I’m 22 years old and I’m from Hanoi. Right now, I study a Bachelor of Information of Technology at RMIT Vietnam but before that, I was a student of Hanoi University of Science. I enjoy playing video games and playing soccer with my friends in my free time. I had my first PC when I was 5, so I have approached the computer from a very early. Then, instead of hanging out to the street, I spent all day playing videos game and exploring my PC. For me, that time in part build my IT interests. Before I go to RMIT, I don’t have any experience in IT major but I believe that I will have a good knowledge of IT ecosystems and able to use all common program languages.</p>

A human passenger is not required to take control of the vehicle at any time, nor is a human passenger required to be present in the vehicle at all. Autonomous Driving can help the vehicle go anywhere as a traditional car go and do anything as an experienced driver do. </p>

    <p>Driverless car work defends on sensors, actuators, complex algorithms, machine learning systems, and powerful processors. All the information input from the environment will be processed by sophisticated software. This software will help the vehicle run follow traffic rules and navigate obstacles. There are 6 of automation levels that mean how technology interferes with the vehicle: from level 1 working as an assistance tool driver to level 6 full automation without human. </p>

    <p>In present, driverless cars can run in a specific route without any human action, we have seen more and more autonomous elements becomes a part of our everyday driving lives.
