    <p>Hello everyone! My full name is Bui Hoang, I’m 22 years old and I’m from Hanoi. Right now, I study a Bachelor of Information of Technology at RMIT Vietnam but before that, I was a student of Hanoi University of Science. I enjoy playing video games and playing soccer with my friends in my free time. I had my first PC when I was 5, so I have approached the computer from a very early. Then, instead of hanging out to the street, I spent all day playing videos game and exploring my PC. For me, that time in part build my IT interests. Before I go to RMIT, I don’t have any experience in IT major but I believe that I will have a good knowledge of IT ecosystems and able to use all common program languages.</p>

So to work in IT area, you need to Deny the thinking that the knowledge in school and always have to be ready and willing to adapt.   </p>

    <h2> 4) IT Technologies </h2>


    <h4> Hoang -Autonomous vehicles area </h4>

    <b> 1) What does it do?</b>

    <p>An Autonomous Driving (AV), also known as a self-driving car or driverless car, robotic car, is a vehicle that is capable of sensing its environment and moving safely with little or no human input. A human passenger is not required to take control of the vehicle at any time, nor is a human passenger required to be present in the vehicle at all. Autonomous Driving can help the vehicle go anywhere as a traditional car go and do anything as an experienced driver do. </p>

    <p>Driverless car work defends on sensors, actuators, complex algorithms, machine learning systems, and powerful processors. All the information input from the environment will be processed by sophisticated software. This software will help the vehicle run follow traffic rules and navigate obstacles. There are 6 of automation levels that mean how technology interferes with the vehicle: from level 1 working as an assistance tool driver to level 6 full automation without human. </p>

    <p>In present, driverless cars can run in a specific route without any human action, we have seen more and more autonomous elements becomes a part of our everyday driving lives. The autonomous cars in Level 1 to level 3 is quite common nowadays. Even in many high-end models, autonomous driving become a standard of their cars. For example, automatic parking becomes a characteristic of BMW and Mercedes.</p>

    <p>As the software improve day by day and the development of technology and GPS net. Driverless cars in the future will become more convenient and safer. Obviously, the price will come down as technology evolves, all vehicles will be Level 5 fully autonomous in the next future. </p>

    <b>2) What is the likely impact?</b>

    <p>Impact for driver</p>

    <p>Autonomous Driving provides increased safety on the road, elimination of driving fatigue, helps drivers being able to sleep during overnight journeys and help people who are not able to drive- due to factors like age and disabilities- could be able to use automated cars as more transport systems. Improving productivity in the workplace as fewer people would have to worry commuting and their stresses.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, the fact that people will change to use autonomous driving instead of traditional cars. A lot of people work mainly by vehicle will be affected because of it. To be more specific, people work in delivery services and taxi services can lose their job with the robot.  </p>

    <p>Impact for Road safety</p>

    <p>The improved safety of roads filled with autonomous vehicles. By removing the human element of driving such as emotions, actions and delay in reactions. We can reduce a lot of the majority of traffic accidents today. Truly, as a reposted in 1.8 million testing miles, Google’s self-driving just had 13 accidents and all of them were caused by the other cars. And with the development of technology, their safety rate will be improving day by day.</p>

    <p>Impact for Insurance </p>

    <p>Because of no driver, a lot of insurance policy will be changing for suitable will the new type of cars. For example, they will have insurance for the owner of the vehicle that have errors in the software. A policy cover customers against hacking car software systems.</p>

    <b>3) How will this affect you? </b>

    <p>As an IT student, Autonomous Driving opened my mind about how the development of technology nowadays and how technology improves the world we live in now. Furthermore, researching this field help me find out that Autonomous Driving is a potential area that I should study.</p>

    <p> As a driver, I see Autonomous Driving as the most convenient and important technology for vehicles. A driverless car can help me more freely and safely than a traditional car. If I am tired and cannot control the vehicle, the driverless car can safety run by driveling itself.</p>

    <h4> Quan - Robots </h4>

    <b> 1) What does it do? </b>
    <p> Robots are related to a scientific term, robotics which refers to a compilation of science, technology and engineering. It is a machine-produced to replace human actions in any possible way. Most people understand or first heard about robots through the introduction in films and books such as Wall-E, Robocop and R2-D2. These concepts of robots in the movies might seem unrealistic and impossible to create at first, but with technologies nowadays, anything is possible in the future.</p>

    <p>For robots to work, it must be created using complex technologies and innovative developments. Many types of robots existed in the industrial world, but in general, robots require electrical components to operate and power the machinery. Another way of saying this is like the need for a battery in a TV remote control so that it can be switch on or change TV channels. The components of robots are somewhat very similar to human beings ones as they also need a muscle system, a brain system, a body structure, a sensor system and a power source. Some might say robots are the replica of humans, where the only thing they differentiate from humans is feelings and emotions. In terms of technologies being used, these comprise artificial skins, muscles, nose, BioTac sensor, and elastic cable.  </p>


    <p>In the present day, robots have been contributing to the operation of many businesses around the world. According to research done in 2005, 90% of robots are used to assemble cars in the automotive industry(ref). It is the most common industry for robots to be implemented where a robotic arm is invented to put different parts of the car together. These types of robots are called autonomous robots where they are created to substitute human works without any pay grade and breaks as it’s more efficient and effective.  Another industry that uses robots is the agricultural industry where a similar type of flying drone is navigated by a person from afar to identify types of plants as well as feeding them. In this case, the robots are called teleoperated robots, where it is operated by humans to carry out difficult tasks in extreme conditions. Moreover, the most recent type of robots that have been trending all over the world and bring a shock to people’s face is humanoid robots. It refers to a machine that is build to copy human’s behaviour and perform similar tasks such as crying, laughing, running jumping and carrying objects. An example of this type of robot is Sofia, the first robot announced and confirmed as a citizen of Saudi Arabia. </p>

    <p>As we all know what robots are capable of right now in the world, imagine in a few years, what else can they do? They already conquered and made a positive impact in the business industry, hence there would be no surprises if they ended changing the way education, security, entertainments and our lifestyle operates. An example of the influence of robots in education is humanoid robots teaching and connecting with students from all over the world. A single teacher couldn’t focus on more than one students learning process and journey, whereas the robots can assist and guide each student to bring out the best of themselves in school. An example of robots improving security might be facial recognition and drone footage to identify criminals which helps all the cops and detectives to bring in the criminal quicker, hence reducing all the crimes in general and making the world a safer place. In terms of entertainment and lifestyles, virtual reality will be introduced in our everyday lives where our voice would control the house through voice activation. </p>

    <b>2) What is the likely impact?</b>

    <p>With the revolutionising of robots, it can both impact people's lives positively and negatively. Typically, in businesses, the use of robots affects them positively as there is more work done, leading to an increase in productivity, hence achieving the business’s profitability. Workers sometimes carry out the task in an unproductive manner when they get demotivated or bored with their current job, which will slow down the production process and affect negatively on the sales of the business. Therefore, there are no doubts that robots will improve business operations towards the achievement of business objectives. </p>

    <p>However, with the robots introduced in the workplace, the people that are affected the most are the factory workers where their assembling tasks are replaced by robotic arms to carry out the job instead as it’s more cost-effective and productive. Disagreements in the workplace occurred when the employees feel like they are no longer needed in the business and hence causes the unemployment rate of the world to increase. Another way of saying this is the employees are made redundant and are forced to resign from the company to find a job elsewhere. Soon in the workplace, there would be no sign of a human being where the whole factory would consist of robots army assembling different components to finalise the product.  </p>

    <b>3) How will this affect you? </b>

    <p>For myself, the implementation of robots in my own home and everyday life would somewhat affect positively in the short term. I no longer need the install of switches or appearance of remotes anymore as I only need my voice to control and operate the whole house. In terms of security, my family and I would be more protected as there is a facial recognition system installed so that no strangers or thefts can enter in or out of the house without alarms or alerts straight to the police. Everything would become more accessible and more convenient, and everyone in my family could be relieved and live their lives to the fullest. However, in the long term, it might negatively affect my daily life when the voice activation would oppose me with system malfunction and the whole system hacked by thieves and hackers. Another disadvantage would be my family and I becoming too dependent on the use of voice activation and refusing to stay active and healthy, both physically and mentally. Therefore, I’m not quite sure with the overall implementation of robots in my everyday life as it could result in some unforeseen consequences. As for myself, I hope the use of robots would be used wisely and appropriately to grow our community and take part in making the world a better place.  </p>

    <h4> HyunMin - Blockchain and cryptocurrencies </h4>

     <b> 1) What does it do? </b>
     <p> From self-driving cars to daily necessities such as smartphones and artificial intelligence robots. The electronic devices, computers, and machines we use are intelligently handling and functioning. Thanks to the "things" that have become smarter, our lives have become more pleasant and faster, and literally more comfortable.</p>
<p>It is no exaggeration to say that machine learning is being used in most areas, including computer science. From computer vision (text recognition, face recognition), to speech recognition and handwriting recognition, information search and search engine, bioinformatics (genetic analysis, disease diagnosis), computer graphics and games (animation, virtual reality), and robotics (pathways exploration, unmanned vehicles) are being applied in many places. </p>

<p>The impact of AI on companies will depend on industries, organizations and customers. Stephen Prentiss Gartner, a fellow and vice president, cited a lawyer who had to spend a long period of time in education and training. Companies that employ lawyers should pay each lawyer an appropriate level of salary and allowance to cover the training costs.</p>

<p>On the other hand, smart machines to replace lawyers also require a long, costly training period. However, for smart machines, after the first one, the company can introduce additional smart machines at a fraction of the cost.</p>

<p>Financial services are also industries where tasks such as loan handling and insurance damage assessment can be automated. The AI is expected to hurt employment in some industries. However, Gartner predicts that while AI and automation in most industries handle regular and repetitive tasks, existing personnel will be able to spend more time raising service levels and dealing with more complex tasks. In addition, many other industries are expected to benefit from the lowered level of stress in high-tension work environments.</p>

<p>Vice President Stephen Prentiss said AI and humans will ultimately have different differences, saying AI is very well-defined and best at solving narrow problems, while humans are good at defining problems that need to be solved and solving complex problems. AI and humans also have a variety of knowledge and skills, and can solve problems in various ways. They can collaborate with each other, and humans can adapt to such changes if the situation changes significantly."</p>

    <h2> 5) Project Ideas</h2>

    <h3> Background Context: </h3>

    <p>System requirements and hardware are some of the critical factors hamper people from using apps and programs. Nowadays, the prices of technology devices are more and more expensive that required customers to invest so much money for their computers. Some occupations even required their employees to have a strong computer. My IT Team Project is making a proprietary software application for desktop sharing, and the user can use apps and programs without installing it on their computer. In overall, this app can help their users break the limit of hardware and freely enjoy technology. </p>

    <h3> Core Problem:</h3>

    <p> Hardware problem </p>

    <h3> Idea/Solution:</h3>

    <h3> How is work?</h3>

    <p> Basically, my all will work as a sharing desktop app, while user a uses my app to use a program, for example, they use my app to use Adobe Premiere. The request for using Adobe Premiere will be spent on the main server. Then from the main server, the signal will move to Workstation. From here the Workstation, the Adobe Premiere will be open and spent back the working screen to the main server and from the main server to the computer of the user. As the circle I given above, this all will received all activities that users do in their devices in the working display screen and give feedback for the main server then from server to Workstation. To be clearer, the users will work with another computer that has Adobe Premiere, their devices just play the role of a screen and receiving user’s interaction, the app just plays the role of a streaming video app.  </p>

    <h3> Design Features:</h3>

    <b>1-Sign up/ Login page in app.</b>

    <p>The initial page when the user opens the app, the user has to login in here to open the app. If users don’t have their account, the app will request users to sign up or create an account in here. Furthermore, the app will have a function to remember the account login that device.</p>

    <b>2-Menu Screen </b>

    <p>The main page of the app is designed as a huge library include a hundred apps.  all the apps will be a group in the major and their functions such as System- Security, Office, Multi-Media, Programming-Design, Applicable Software, Game and, Movie. All the apps will be sorted by the ranking of users in each major.</p>

    <b>3-Confirmation Screen </b>

    <p>While clicking on the app you want to work in, the user will be moved to the confirmation page that asked the user if they want to work in this app or not. </p>

    <b>4-Working Sceen </b>

    <p>User will work in the app they want in this page</p>

    <b>5-Supporting Screen </b>

    <p> This page will have a tutorial for newbie and a 24/7 support chatting to answer and support users. Moreover, user can be able to change the app language to another one in this screen  </p>

    <b>Tools and Technologies required </b>

    <p>A big cloud database server</p>

    <p>A Workstation</p>

    <p>A program to transfer information to the server. </p>

    <p>An agreement from many technology companies to allow their products in this app. </p>

    <b>Skills Required </b>

    <p>A huge range of knowledge of cloud computing network and its service</p>

    <p>A wide knowledge about hardware infrastructure, data center facilities and virtualization technologies.</p>

    <p>Programming languages relative to cloud computing such as Python, Java, ASP.NET, PHP and RUBY.  </p>

    <b>Outcome</b>

    <p>Being a helpful and friendly app for low-quality computer’s user.</p>

    <p>Changing the habit of customers while they buy a new device.  They don’t need to buy a powerful computer for their work and a console device for their entertainment, all they need just an app can connect every app they want.</p>
